If you have enabled
<BR>&#160;<BR>
 [X]  Alternate Compose Menu 
<BR>&#160;<BR>
then this patch will add two new subcommands to the compose command. Here
are their descriptions:
<UL>
<LI> <B class=remark>S</B>:
If you are reading a message from a person, and you would like to
compose a new message to that person, then this option will enter
the address in the From: field of that message into the To: field of
the new message. This allows you to start a fresh conversation
with that person, without using the reply command, which might not
always be the best way to start a conversation (thread) with another user.
One of the main advantages of this approach is that is makes composing
a message to a person faster than entering their address or nickname
in the To: field.
<LI> <B class=remark>M</B>:
If you are reading a message that was sent to a mailing list, this
option will add the address of the mailing list in the To: field of
your message. In many mailing lists, people are frowned upon if they
reply to an old message to start a new message to the list. Using this
option will start a new message (thread) in that mailing list.
</UL>
These options are not available in case that the alternate composer menu
is not enabled, as they slow down users to start composing a message.
