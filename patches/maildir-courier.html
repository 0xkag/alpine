<B class=title>Support for Courier/Cyrus/Dovecot file systems in the Maildir patch for Alpine</B>

<BR>&#160;<BR>
If you are familiar with the original Maildir patch this is an extra
feature added to that patch, so most of the configuration is done
very similarly.
<BR>&#160;<BR>
In a courier/cyrus/dovecot file system (henceforth called Courier for 
brevity) all folders are subfolders of a root folder called INBOX. 
Normally INBOX is located at ~/Maildir and subfolders are &quot;dot&quot; 
directories in ~/Maildir. For example ~/Maildir/.Trash is a subfolder of 
INBOX and is accessed with the nickname &quot;INBOX.Trash&quot;.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can not access folders in this way unless you preceed them with the 
string &quot;#mc/&quot;. The purpose of the string &quot;#mc/&quot; is to warn Alpine that a 
collection in the Courier format is going to be accessed, so you can 
SELECT a folder like &quot;#mc/INBOX.Trash&quot;, but not &quot;INBOX.Trash&quot;

<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can access a collection through a server, but if you want to access a 
collection of folders created using the Courier server, you MUST edit your
&quot;.pinerc&quot; file and enter the definition of the collection as follows:

<BR>&#160;<BR>
folder-collections=&quot;Anything you want&quot; #mc/INBOX.[]

<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can replace the string &quot;#mc/INBOX.&quot; by something different, for example
&quot;#mc/Maildir/.&quot; will make Alpine search for your collection in ~/Maildir.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can not add this directly into Alpine because Alpine fails to accept this 
value from its input, but it takes it correctly when it is added through 
the &quot;.pinerc&quot; file.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can access your inbox as &quot;#mc/INBOX&quot; or &quot;#md/INBOX&quot;. Both definitions 
point to the same place.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
Please <A HREF="mailto:alpine.chappa@gmx.com">send me</A> all 
feedback you have about the patch so that it can be improved in later
versions.
<BR>&#160;<BR>
Thanks
