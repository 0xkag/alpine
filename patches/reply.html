This patch adds a configuration option called "<B class=special>Alternate 
Reply Menu</B>", which when activated allows you to override and set 
values for configuration options that otherwise are not possible to 
override. (e.g. you may have set the option to strip signatures, but for 
the message you are answering you would like not to do that)

<BR>&#160;<BR>
  
The way this feature works is as follows. Initially you get the question
if you want to include the message, and in the menu you will see several
options, each option is accompanied by some text explaining what will
happen if you press the associated command. For example, if you read the text
"<B class=remark>S</B> <B class=special>Strip Sig</B>", it means that if you press 
<B class=remark>S</B>, the signature will be
stripped off the message you are replying. 
Note that when you do this the menu in the bottom will change to
"<B class=remark>S</B> <B class=special>No Strip</B>". These options
will be activated when you press RETURN.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
The possible options are:

<OL> 

<LI> <B class=special>A:</B> This determines if Alpine 
will include or not the attachments sent to you in the message that you 
are replying. By default Alpine will use the value of the configuration 
option include-attachments-in-reply, but you can use this option to 
override such behavior in a per message basis.


<LI><B class=special>F:</B> To decide if you want to send flowed text 
or not. This option appears unless you have quelled sending flowed text.

<LI><B class=special>H:</B> This option determines if the headers of a
message are to be included in the body of the message that is being
replied. By default Alpine will use the value of the configuration option
include-header-in-reply, but you can use this option to override such
behavior in a per message basis.

<LI> <B class=special>R:</B> To set a role, if you do not want Alpine to
set one automatically for you or would like to set one when you can not
select any.

<LI> <B class=special>S:</B> To strip the signature from a message, 
only available is the feature enable-sigdashes or the 
strip-from-sigdashes-on-reply option are enabled.

</OL>
