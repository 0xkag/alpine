<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can use this patch to add functionality to the thread interface offered
by Alpine. It adds commands and options that control several aspects of the
way threads are presented.

<UL>
<LI>
You can delete a thread, by pressing 
<B class=remark>^R</B> (to remove), you can undelete it by pressing <B class=remark>^U</B> (without
this patch, you would have to collapse the thread before you can delete it). 
<BR>&#160;<BR>
            
<LI>
You can select and unselect a thread, by pressing <B class=remark>^T</B>. This is useful if you want to
make aggregate operations on a thread, like saving it. 
<BR>&#160;<BR>

<LI>

You can collapse or expand a particular thread by pressing <B class=remark>[</B> or <B class=remark>]</B>
respectively. If you want to collapse or expand ALL threads, use the
commands <B class=remark>{</B> and <B class=remark>}</B> respectively. These last two commands work only if you
have selected any of the options <BR> <B class=remark>(*) regular-index-with-expanded/collapsed-threads</B>.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
            
<LI>
You can move to the next or previous thread by pressing <B class=remark>)</B>
or <B class=remark>(</B> respectively.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
            
<LI>
You can sort threads by arrival, in order to do this press 
<B class=remark>k a</B>. There are other sorts for threads by Date and by
Score. If you want to have threads permanently sorted
by arrival, say, then set the variable <B class=remark>thread-sort-key</B> to be arrival. You can
also start Alpine with the option <B class=remark>-threadsort arrival</B> to accomplish the
same.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
            
<LI>
Similarly, you can sort threads by their length. In order to do this press 
<B class=remark>k z</B>. Small threads appear at the beginning of the listing,
while long threads appear at the bottom. Threads of the same length are sorted
according to the date of their first message. In particular, single message
threads are sorted by date.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
            
<LI>
A new configuration option was added:<BR> 
<B class=remark>[X] enhanced-fancy-thread-support</B> <BR>
if you enable this configuration option, then all of the above commands
will act on loose threads, which are threads without parents.

<BR>&#160;<BR>
            
<LI>
The <B class=remark>SIZETHREAD</B> index token was added, which tells you the size of a
thread, instead of the size of the individual messages in the thread.
</UL>

<B class=remark>BUGS:</B> When the configuration option enhanced-fancy-thread-support is
enabled, the command <B class=remark>/</B> will not act on the full thread (for loose
threads), but only on branches of it. I am not quite sure that I want to
change this, because it gives you flexibility. In particular collapsing a
branch and pressing D, will delete the branch and not the thread, so you
would have an extra option :). My advice is that you do not enable
slash-collapses-entire-thread, since this will give you much more
flexibility. In every possible situation I've found this, I've seen it as an
advantage and not as a disadvantage, I hope you do too.
