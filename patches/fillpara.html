When you reply to a message, which has been quoted by several people and
you justify a paragraph, Alpine may not notice any other quote strings and
justify the paragraph as if there was no other quote strings in it. This
patch will help Alpine recognize extra levels of quoting, so that justifying
will still make the text readable. This is important because the purpose
of justification is to make the text more readable, and an incorrect
justification may make the text impossible to read.

<BR>&#160;<BR> 
Here's a real example:

<BR>&#160;<BR> 
<span style="color:#0000bb;">
The following text is not justified:
</span>
<PRE>
:) > this is a
:) > test
:) >
:) >
</PRE>
<span style="color:#0000bb;">
 If we justified this text in Alpine we'd get
</span>

<PRE>
:) > this is a > test > >
:) 
:) 
</PRE>

<span style="color:#0000bb;">
If you apply the patch and justify the above text, you'd get
</span>

<PRE>
:) > this is a test
:) >
:) >
</PRE>

<span style="color:#0000bb;">
Note how quote levels were preserved.
</span>


<BR>&#160;<BR> 
It's very difficult, although not impossible, to fool the algorithm. I
still have to find a real life example where I can fool the algorithm, if
you find one please let me know. As usual, the Ctrl-U command can undo
justification, so keep it in mind if you find that the patch does not do
its work correctly.

<BR>&#160;<BR> <A href="../readme/fillpara.html">Here</A> there are more
interesting examples.

<BR>&#160;<BR><B class=remark>New:</B> Additionally, if you use Alpine with 
colors, now this patch was added some code that will allow you to read 
different quoting levels in different colors. <A 
HREF="../images/fillpara.gif">Here</A> you can see an image that shows 3 
different labels painted correctly. This patch 
also supports flowed text. This means that if flowed text contains a 
non standard quote string it will be wrapped correctly. For example, you 
can see <A HREF="../images/flowedexpanded.gif">image</A> which shows 
flowed text in a terminal 80 columns wide. If you compress this text, <A 
HREF="../images/flowedcompressed.gif">you can see</A> that text is wrapped 
and painted correctly.
<BR>&#160;<BR>
You can also
remove paragraphs. 
The command <B class=remark>^W^P</B> can be used to erase the paragraph 
over which the cursor is. If the cursor is not over a paragraph, Pico will 
delete the paragraph following to the position of the cursor. Paragraphs 
that are quoted are also recognized by this patch (and it is the main 
reason why this functionality was added to this patch). You can recover a 
paragraph that you just deleted by pressing <B class=remark>^U</B>. If you 
delete two consecutive paragraphs without pressing any other key in 
between, then pressing <B class=remark>^U</B> will recover both 
paragraphs.
<BR>&#160;<BR> 
The variable quote-suppression-threshold also controls the number of 
quoted consecutive lines that are displayed, not only those quoted using 
the &gt; character.

<BR>&#160;<BR> 
Alpine has basic support for justification of
more than one quoting level, but only when the quote string in every
level of quoting is the same (this means that, other quote strings are
not recognized). That implementation of justification has some bugs which
do not allow it to recognize certain combinations of the same quote
string (in raw form). For example, if a text is quoted with  the quote string
"&gt;&#160;&#160;" (two spaces at the end), Alpine will fail to recognize 
quoted text, even if it is justified with the "&gt;" or "&gt; " quote
strings.

<BR>&#160;<BR> 
The editor nano (version 1.2.0) also has support for multiple levels 
of quoting, but it does not support all quotes that this algorithm supports
out of the box. For example, nano supports several levels of arbitrary
quote strings starting the editor with the command "nano". If you do so, the above
test text will be justified as:
<PRE>
:) > this is a ) > test ) > ) >
</PRE>
You can always justify correctly if you tell nano what the quote string is,
and that's a big difference with this algorithm, in which you don't have to
tell the algorithm what is the quote string, but it will guess it pretty well.
It is my understanding that other editors (e.g. vim) behave in a similar way
to nano.
